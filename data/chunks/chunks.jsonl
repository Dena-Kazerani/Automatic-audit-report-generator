Model Overview\nThe ICAAP Credit Risk Model estimates portfolio economic capital using a simulation-based \napproach. The model aggregates expected and unexpected losses across Corporate, SME, Retail \nSecured, and Retail Unsecured segments.\nCompared with 2023, the 2024 model includes:\n• an increased number of simulations (from 5,000 to 10,000),\n• a revised correlation parameter (from 0.18 to 0.22),\n• improved PD and LGD consistency checks,\n• partial versioning of the Python scripts.\n3.

A \nuniform asset correlation parameter of 0.22 is applied across all segments (Corporate, SME, Retail \nSecured, Retail Unsecured). The purpose of this parameter is to approximate the impact of a \ncommon systematic risk driver without introducing excessive model complexity.\nThe justiﬁcation for the choice of 0.22 is based on a combination of internal judgment and a high-\nlevel comparison with regulatory references. Internal discussions concluded that correlations \nmaterially below 0.20 tended to underestimate portfolio volatility, while values above 0.25 \nproduced capital levels that were considered unrealistically high compared with historical loss \nexperience. As a compromise, a value of 0.22 was retained for 2024, in line with the Bank’s \nconservative stance, although no formal quantitative calibration study has yet been completed.\nNo differentiated correlation is applied by sector or geography at this stage, mainly due to data"}

The \nmodel is designed to complement regulatory capital requirements by reﬂecting the Bank’s internal \nview of risk, portfolio speciﬁcs, and long-term risk appetite.\nCompared to previous years, the YEAR 2025 version introduces several limited changes: a reﬁned \nsegmentation for SME exposures, a small adjustment to downturn LGD inputs, and a revised \naggregation ﬁle in Excel intended to improve transparency. However, several simpliﬁcations remain \nin place, particularly regarding macroeconomic dynamics, dependency structures, and the \nimplementation approach (which still relies heavily on Excel sheets and manually executed Python \nscripts).\nThe model estimates the Bank’s credit economic capital for YEAR 2025 at €1.83bn, representing a"}

The increase is primarily driven by a deterioration of the \nSME portfolio and a small upward revision of LGD assumptions.\nWhile the core methodology remains broadly appropriate for ICAAP purposes, the reliance on \nmanually maintained ﬁles, incomplete documentation of data lineage, and the lack of detailed \nvalidation evidence on parameter stability remain important limitations to be addressed in \nsubsequent versions.\nPART II — Model Overview\nThe ICAAP Credit Risk Model estimates unexpected losses (UL) at the portfolio level over a one-\nyear horizon and at a 99.9% conﬁdence level. The model uses a Monte-Carlo–based simulation \nframework combined with segment-level loss distributions derived from internal historical data.\nThe methodology is conceptually aligned with industry practice: exposures are grouped into \nsegments, each segment is characterised by point-in-time PD and downturn LGD, and a loss \ndistribution is simulated using a one-factor Gaussian copula approximation.

While acceptable for capital planning, this simpliﬁcation reduces the model’s ability to \ncapture long-term risk build-up.\nSimpliﬁed correlation structure\nA single correlation parameter (ρ = 0.23) is applied across all segments. \nThis ignores sectoral and geographic dependencies, which may underestimate concentration risk.\nNo explicit macroeconomic drivers\nPDs and LGDs implicitly include macroeconomic effects, but no macro model is used. \nThis makes the model less sensitive to economic downturns and limits consistency with ICAAP \nstress-testing frameworks.\n9.2 Data & Input Limitations\nData lineage incomplete\nAlthough YEAR 2025 introduced a more formal folder structure, lineage remains described \nmanually in Excel. \nNo automated logging or metadata checks are performed.\nMissing and inconsistent data"}

The objective of this review was to assess the \ndegree of remediation implemented by the Credit Risk Modelling team following last year’s critical \naudit, and to evaluate whether the 2024 version brings the model closer to ICAAP expectations and \nEBA standards.\nThe 2024 model shows meaningful progress compared with 2023. The documentation is more \nstructured, the simulation framework is partially clariﬁed, and basic validation elements have been \nintroduced. Internal Audit acknowledges a genuine effort by the modelling team to strengthen the \nmodel in a limited timeframe.\nHowever, despite these improvements, several structural limitations remain. A number of essential \naspects of ICAAP model governance, data lineage, methodological transparency, and validation \nremain only partially remediated.

The model continues to rely heavily on manual processes, the \nrationale for key assumptions is still weak, and the level of reproducibility remains insufﬁcient for a \nmodel producing capital ﬁgures of this importance.\nThis review concludes that the model is moving in the right direction, but is not yet fully \ncompliant with internal standards and requires further enhancement during 2025.\n2. Progress Compared With 2023\nThe 2024 documentation marks a divergence from the very incomplete 2023 version. Internal Audit \nrecognises the following improvements :\nDocumentation quality. \nThe structure is clearer, with explicit sections on data sources, assumptions, methodology, and \ngovernance. The annexes, although still incomplete, now contain real content rather than \nplaceholders or descriptive commentary.\nSimulation framework. \nThe number of Monte Carlo simulations has been doubled, and the modelling steps are at least \nbroadly described. The introduction of a parameter table in Annex B, although minimal, helps \nreaders understand the lognormal setup."}

Key Remaining Issues\n3.1 Documentation and Methodology Transparency\nAlthough the 2024 documentation is more complete than that of 2023, it does not yet reach the level \nof clarity required for ICAAP. Mathematical formulation of the simulation remains absent, \ncalibration steps are not described, and the choice of lognormal parameters is presented without \njustiﬁcation.

Recommendations for 2025\nInternal Audit recommends that the modelling team undertake the following actions during 2025 :\n1. Produce a complete and formalised model documentation including methodology, \nmathematical deﬁnitions, data lineage, calibration steps, and validation results.\n2. Automate and document the data extraction and transformation process, reducing \nmanual Excel operations.\n3. Introduce a proper version control framework, preferably using Git, with documented \nchange management."}

The model constitutes a fundamental component of the Bank’s internal \ncapital assessment and is expected to meet the standards required by the EBA Guidelines on ICAAP \n(EBA/GL/2016/10).\nOverall, the audit concludes that:\n The model, as implemented and documented in 2023, does not meet the \nminimum standards of conceptual soundness, implementation quality, data \ngovernance, or documentation completeness expected for ICAAP purposes.\nSigniﬁcant issues were identiﬁed across all dimensions:\n• Incomplete and insufﬁcient documentation\n• Lack of clear data lineage\n• Missing deﬁnitions for key inputs\n• No description of the simulation framework\n• Weaknesses in Excel implementation\n• Absence of version control\n• Missing validation evidence\n• Material data quality problems\n• Ambiguity about roles and responsibilities"}
